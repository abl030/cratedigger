"""Contract tests for nix/module.nix.

The Nix wrappers in ``nix/module.nix`` decide what environment
subprocesses (``beet``, ``import_one.py``, etc.) inherit. Historically,
leaks here have caused pipeline-wide failures that were hard to trace:

* 2026-04-21 ``cratedigger-web`` force-import path crashed on every
  post-import ``beet remove`` with ``ModuleNotFoundError: No module
  named 'msgspec'``. Root cause: the wrapper exported
  ``PYTHONPATH=${src}:${src}/lib:${src}/web:...`` which put
  ``lib/beets.py`` at sys.path top level as a bare ``beets`` module,
  shadowing the real beets PyPI package. The ``beet`` subprocess did
  ``from beets.ui import main`` → loaded our ``lib/beets.py`` → hit
  ``import msgspec`` (line 11) → ``ModuleNotFoundError`` because the
  beet-wrapped Python doesn't carry msgspec. The accumulated effect
  was three split-brain rows for one MBID (Unter Null "Sick Fuck"
  request 1748).

These grep-based contracts are cheap to write and catch the whole
class of "an export in module.nix leaked into a subprocess and broke
something five layers away". They run inside the Python suite because
we don't want to depend on ``nix eval`` at test time — a text grep
against the source file is enough for the invariants we care about.
