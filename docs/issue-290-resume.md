# Issue #290 — resume note

This is the **entry point** for picking up the stateful-MagicMock removal effort with fresh context. Read this first; the long-form context lives in issues #290 (master plan) and #301 (deferred items + refactor ideas).

## Current state

Baseline last measured at **160 findings across 15 files**. To check the live count:

```bash
nix-shell --run "python3 tests/_rebuild_mock_audit_baseline.py"
# Then:
nix-shell --run "python3 -c '
import json
b = json.load(open(\"tests/mock_audit_baseline.json\"))
print(f\"baseline: {sum(sum(v.values()) for v in b.values())}, files: {len(b)}\")
for f, kinds in sorted(b.items(), key=lambda kv: sum(kv[1].values())):
    print(f\"  {sum(kinds.values()):>3}  {f}\")
'"
```

If the live count differs from this doc, this doc is stale — trust the live count and update this file as part of your next PR.

## Mental model

A finding is one of two things:
1. **`stateful_mock_assign:NAME`** — a variable assignment like `db = MagicMock()` for a name implying a stateful collaborator. Replacement: `FakePipelineDB` / `FakePipelineDBSource` / `FakeSlskdAPI` / a `Fake*` subclass.
2. **`patch:lib.x.y`** — a `patch()` call against a function the audit considers "ours, not a seam." Either migrate to drive real code with a fake, or — if the function is genuinely a thin boundary wrapper — add to `tests/_mock_audit_scanner.py::_LEAF_SEAM_PATTERNS` with a rationale comment.

The audit is in `tests/test_mock_audit.py`; the scanner heuristic lives in `tests/_mock_audit_scanner.py`; the frozen call-site count is in `tests/mock_audit_baseline.json`.

## Three concrete next moves (in order of value-per-effort)

### 1. Item N in #301 — DI refactor for `try_enqueue` match function (~half day)

`test_enqueue_fanout.py` carries **37 patches** of `lib.enqueue.check_for_match` — the wave-shape tests need to control which user "wins" the match. Migrating cleanly requires either elaborate per-user `FakeSlskdAPI.users.set_directory` setup or a small production DI refactor:

```python
def try_enqueue(..., match_fn: MatchFn = check_for_match): ...
```

Then tests pass a stub callable by value. Production stays the same default. PR title: `refactor(enqueue): inject check_for_match for wave-shape testability`. Drops 37 findings.

### 2. Item K in #301 — DI refactor for `_check_quality_gate_core` (~half day)

13 patches across `test_dispatch_core.py` (4), `test_dispatch_from_db.py` (5), `test_import_dispatch.py` (4). Same DI pattern: pass the quality gate as a function arg into `dispatch_import_core(..., quality_gate_fn=_check_quality_gate_core)`. PR title: `refactor(import-dispatch): inject quality_gate_core for orchestration tests`. Drops 13 findings.

### 3. Item M in #301 — `_execute` support on `FakePipelineDB` (~2 hours)

14 sites in `test_pipeline_cli.py` (mostly TestCmdQuery, TestCmdRepairSpectral) inject SQL cursor results via `db._execute.side_effect = [cursor1, cursor2, ...]`. Add a minimal `_execute` simulator to FakePipelineDB that lets tests register the cursor sequence — same shape as the existing `set_directory_*` pattern on FakeSlskdAPI. PR title: `test(fakes): add _execute cursor stubbing to FakePipelineDB`. Drops 14 findings.

After all three: baseline drops ~64 → ~96 remaining. That residual is mostly `finalize_request` in `test_web_server.py` contract tests (26 sites) — those need either per-test DB seeding (heavy) OR the same DI treatment for `finalize_request` (likely the right move; tracked separately).

## What's NOT next

- **Don't migrate one-off var-name sites** until the three DI refactors land. They're already on the residual list and individually low-yield.
- **Don't extend the allowlist further** unless you find a genuine thin seam wrapper I missed. The current allowlist is already covering all the obvious subprocess/HTTP/filesystem wrappers.
- **Don't try to delete `mock_audit_baseline.json`** (Phase 3 of #290) until the baseline reaches 0. The grandfather approach is the whole point.

## How to run the workflow

Each migration PR follows the same shape:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/mock-migrate-WHAT main
# Make changes
nix-shell --run "python3 -m unittest tests.test_WHAT"    # target file passes
nix-shell --run "bash scripts/run_tests.sh"               # full suite passes
nix-shell --run pyright                                   # 0 errors on full repo
python3 tests/_rebuild_mock_audit_baseline.py             # baseline shrinks
git add -A && git commit -m "test(WHAT): migrate ..."
git push -u origin feat/mock-migrate-WHAT
gh pr create --base main --title "test(WHAT): ..." --body "..."
gh pr merge <PR> --merge --delete-branch
```

The pre-commit hook + audit + skip-audit gates all enforce themselves. If the audit fails on a PR, either:
- You added a new anti-pattern site → fix or use a typed fake
- You removed sites but didn't re-snapshot → run `python3 tests/_rebuild_mock_audit_baseline.py`

## Pointers

- **Master plan**: issue #290
- **Deferred items / refactor ideas**: issue #301
- **Rule**: `.claude/rules/code-quality.md` § "MOCKS: LEAF-SEAM ONLY"
- **Audit**: `tests/test_mock_audit.py`, `tests/_mock_audit_scanner.py`
- **Fakes**: `tests/fakes.py` (FakePipelineDB, FakePipelineDBSource, FakeSlskdAPI)
- **Skip-test ban (related)**: `tests/test_skip_audit.py`, CLAUDE.md § "Skipped tests are an anti-pattern"

## Maintenance

Update this file whenever:
- Baseline drops or grows significantly (every PR is fine)
- An item on the "three next moves" list lands — replace with the new next-best
- The mental model changes (new heuristic, new fake category)

Don't update for individual migrations that don't change the strategic picture.
