# Cratedigger — Music Acquisition Pipeline

A quality-obsessed music acquisition pipeline. Searches Soulseek via slskd, validates downloads against MusicBrainz/Discogs via beets, auto-imports with spectral quality verification, or stages for manual review. Web UI at `music.ablz.au`. Originally inspired by [mrusse/soularr](https://github.com/mrusse/soularr); long since its own project — the pipeline DB is the sole source of truth, the web UI is the album picker.

## Session start

Before doing anything else, silently run `hostname` and `date`. Then read
`.claude/memory/MEMORY.md` unless the client already injected it. This establishes
the current machine, time, and shared cross-agent memory.

Do not use Compound Engineering (`ce-*`, `compound-engineering:*`, or `lfg`) in
this repository. Native agent planning, implementation, debugging, and review
are sufficient.

## Why this exists — the archivist frame

Cratedigger is a **music archival tool first, an acquisition pipeline second**. The operator is an archivist: most of the long-tail music here is genuinely vanishing — niche pressings, Australian indie, demos that lived on one peer who logged off years ago. This frame is load-bearing; these invariants flow from it:

- **Strict pressing identity.** A request points at a specific MB release MBID or Discogs release ID. The matcher NEVER substitutes a sibling pressing. Different pressings ARE different releases.
- **The system never stops searching.** Cadence is constant forever; never auto-throttled based on apparent unfindability. Surfacing the unfindable cohort is right; throttling search on it is a product violation.
- **The system never auto-decides anything irreversible.** Surfacing is fine; replace/remove/accept-different-pressing decisions belong to the operator.
- **No adapter code between MB and Discogs.** Both feed the same columns in the same shape.
- **Long-tail rescue is a celebrated event** — `rescued_at` + `prior_unfindable_category` on `album_requests` are first-class audit data.
- **Single-operator, no backwards-compat.** One user, forward-only migrations, no compat shims, no committed backfill scripts, no one-shot machinery kept "in case". Full rules in `.claude/rules/scope.md` (always loaded).

If a design drifts toward "good enough" matches, "smart" defaults, or auto-throttling — that drift is a bug. Push back.

## Critical invariants (read first — these will bite you)

1. **Run `hostname` at the start of every chat.** `proxmox-vm` = doc1, `doc2` = doc2, `framework` = Framework laptop, `DESKTOP-*` = Windows. You are likely already on doc1 — do NOT ssh to doc1 from doc1.
2. **Windows laptop SSH**: no native key. Extract via WSL: `wsl -d NixOS -- bash -c 'cat /run/secrets/ssh_key_abl030' > ~/.ssh/id_doc2 && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_doc2`, then `ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_doc2 abl030@doc2` (works for doc1 too).
3. **nixosconfig changes MUST be made on doc1** (`~/nixosconfig`; it has the Forgejo token + signing key). Edit, commit (signed), push, then deploy to doc2.
4. **Pipeline DB is PostgreSQL on doc2** (nspawn `cratedigger-db` at `10.20.0.11:5432`; DSN in `/var/lib/cratedigger/config.ini`). The `10.20.0.0/24` subnet is doc2-local — query via `pipeline-cli` over SSH to doc2, never raw TCP from elsewhere. Request statuses: `wanted`, `downloading`, `imported`, `unsearchable`, `replaced` (terminal, frozen audit). `unsearchable` is an explicit, reversible operator search stop; it is orthogonal to source cleanup such as Bad Rip / ban-source. Import queue: `queued`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`.
5. **This is a curated collection.** Multiple editions/pressings of the same album are intentional. NEVER delete or merge duplicate albums — beets disambiguates them into separate folders.
6. **The pipeline self-heals — the request is the source of truth, everything else is derived.** Operator actions that touch identity supersede the row rather than mutate it (canonical example: Replace, `lib/mbid_replace_service.py` — old row flips to `replaced`, new row points back via `replaces_request_id`, next cycle rebuilds).
7. **Don't duplicate convergence — reuse the cleanup paths that already exist.** Prefer letting existing convergence (e.g. `lib/slskd_transfers.py::converge_slskd_orphans`) reap orphans over adding bespoke teardown to an action.
8. **Wildcard-all-artist-tokens stays.** `lib/search.py::wildcard_artist_tokens` wildcards EVERY artist token (bypasses Soulseek server-side artist-name bans, which are exact-string keyed). Deliberate; do not "optimize" to first-token-only.

## Subsystems (one line + the doc that owns it)

- **Web UI** — SPA, stdlib `http.server`, vanilla JS, no build step; MB/Discogs browse toggle. `docs/webui-primer.md`.
- **Beets** — cratedigger-owned end-to-end: pinned package (`nix/beets.nix`), module-rendered config at `${stateDir}/beets` (BEETSDIR), `cratedigger-beet` (run with sudo) for manual ops. **The shipped beets is the ONLY thing that may touch the library** — a foreign beets version/config against the same library DB risks schema migration and path rewrites (the beets-2.12 and asciify_paths incidents). All automated imports go through the JSON harness — never raw `beet import`. `musicbrainz` MUST be in the plugins list (else 0 candidates); always match by `candidate_id`, never `candidate_index`. Runs as a non-root service user with a setgid group-`users` library (media-server-readable art via the `permissions` plugin, issue #570). `docs/beets-primer.md`.
- **Plex / Jellyfin** — post-import scan notifiers. **Plex's refresh endpoint returns HTTP 200 for any path, including invalid ones — 200 is not evidence the scan ran.** Upgrades are kept out of "Recently Added" by pin reconcilers (Plex `addedAt`, migration 040; Jellyfin `DateCreated` incl. audio children, migration 046 — waits for the rescan to be observable, no fixed settle window). Jellyfin item identity is a hash of the path, so a path-changing upgrade mints new items: capture falls back to the replaced beets albums' old paths (`postflight.replaced_albums`), else writes a floor pin from the pipeline's own first-known date (migration 053). `docs/plex-primer.md`, `docs/jellyfin-primer.md`.
- **Mirrors** — MB mirror + Discogs mirror (Rust JSON API) + LRCLIB, all optional config (`musicbrainz.apiBase` is ONE value threaded to web, CLI, and beets; public MB is the supported-but-slow fallback; Discogs browse is mirror-required). `docs/mirrors.md`, `docs/musicbrainz-mirror.md`, `docs/discogs-mirror.md`.
- **Quality model** — codec-aware rank comparison; ranks govern relative replacement and search scope, while proof governs terminal acceptance. `docs/quality-ranks.md`, `docs/quality-verification.md`.
- **slskd client + event ingestion** — all slskd HTTP via the in-repo typed client `lib/slskd_client.py`. Event ingestion (`lib/slskd_events.py`) stamps completed-file locations from the slskd events feed; **the event is the ONLY source of completed-file locations** (unstamped file at materialize = hard failure, then self-heal to `wanted`). Deletions are event-driven paths + empty-dir pruning — never an inferred-folder rmtree. **Good-citizen ownership (#571, reversing #550's own-the-instance doctrine): cratedigger only destroys slskd state/files it can positively prove it created — a shared instance is safe.** `converge_slskd_orphans` cancels STRAY transfers only when an accepted ledger row confirms Cratedigger created that `(username, filename)` queue key and no `downloading` row still backs it; pending intents and foreign keys are NEVER cancelled, whatever their state or age. `reap_disk_orphans` (Phase 0b, `lib/slskd_transfers.py`) deletes files older than 7 days that it can positively prove it created — good-citizen doctrine (#571 PR 4): an event-stamped `local_path`, or under a canonical folder derived from an accepted ledger row's `attempt_fingerprint` (past OR present attempts). A file with no positive ownership signal is NEVER deleted however old (pre-#571 debris from before migration 045 shipped included — an operator one-shot clears that at deploy, not the reaper's job going forward); the `failed_imports/` quarantine tree (cratedigger's own tree by construction, but protected — never reap-eligible) and a currently-`downloading` row's active canonical folder/stamped paths stay protected regardless of ledger ownership or age. Never park files there. Searches cratedigger submits are write-ahead ledgered (migration 044) and reaped by `converge_slskd_searches` (Phase 0c, `lib/slskd_searches.py`); unledgered searches are never touched (#576). Every slskd file Cratedigger enqueues is likewise write-ahead ledgered by `(username, filename)` before the POST (migration 045, `slskd_enqueue_with_outcome` in `lib/slskd_transfers.py`), but that intent becomes destructive ownership only after slskd accepts the POST; completion events add paths only to already-confirmed rows and never promote rejected/unknown intent. slskd may assign fresh transfer IDs while retrying that queue entry, so the end-of-cycle purge removes every terminal `Completed,*` record with a confirmed queue key using the record's current ID and `remove=true`; pending, foreign, and nonterminal rows are untouched. Transfer cleanup does not authorize disk deletion: only the event-stamped `local_path` or another positive file-ownership signal does. Migration 051 adds the acceptance boundary and removes the obsolete attempt-ID and terminal-stamp columns. Phase 0d (`lib/slskd_transfer_ledger.py`) prunes pending intents once old regardless of request status; accepted ownership evidence retains active `wanted`/`downloading` protection (retention strictly exceeds the reaper's age threshold — a pruned accepted row's file becomes unowned and is never reaped after that).
- **Persisted search plans** — deterministic per-request plans; the executor consumes plan-items by ordinal, never recomputes. **Bump `SEARCH_PLAN_GENERATOR_ID` in `lib/search.py` whenever generator output changes.** `docs/persisted-search-plans-rollout.md`.
- **Unfindable detection** — its own daily oneshot unit (`cratedigger-unfindable.service`), deliberately NOT in the main pipeline loop so the never-stop-searching invariant is enforceable at the systemd level. `docs/search-plan-iter2-deploy.md`.
- **Triage** — `pipeline-cli triage show/list/quarantine` + `/api/triage/*`; composes unfindable + field-resolution + search forensics and surfaces unreferenced immediate `failed_imports/` album folders. Read-only. `docs/search-plan-iter2-deploy.md`, `docs/pipeline-db-schema.md`.
- **YouTube resolver + rescue ingest** — resolver maps a release ID to YT Music albums with beets distances; rescue runs yt-dlp into the existing preview→importer chain (own systemd unit for network-namespacing). `album_requests.status` is never touched by rescue code — only `mark_imported_with_rescue` writes it. `docs/plans/2026-05-28-001-feat-youtube-rescue-ingest-api-plan.md`.
- **API discoverability** — `GET /api/_index` / `pipeline-cli routes`; every route needs a description (route-audit test enforces).

## Infrastructure

- **doc1** (`192.168.1.29`): this repo at `/home/abl030/cratedigger`; primary dev host.
- **doc2** (`192.168.1.35`): runs cratedigger (systemd oneshot; the timer starts the next cycle 1s after the last completes — `OnUnitInactiveSec`, cycles run back-to-back, ~4-5 min each) + module-owned beets, MB mirror (`:5200`), slskd (`:5030`).
- **Shared storage**: `/mnt/virtio` (virtiofs) — beets DB, pipeline DB data, music library reachable from both.
- **Nix deployment**: cratedigger is a flake input (`cratedigger-src`) in `~/nixosconfig/flake.nix`; downstream wrapper at `~/nixosconfig/modules/nixos/services/cratedigger.nix` imports `nixosModules.default`. `docs/nixos-module.md`.

### Key paths

| Path | Machine | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `10.20.0.11:5432/cratedigger` | doc2 nspawn | Pipeline DB (PostgreSQL) |
| `/mnt/virtio/Music/beets-library.db` | shared | Beets library DB |
| `/mnt/virtio/Music/Beets` | shared | Beets library (tagged files) |
| `/mnt/virtio/Music/Incoming` | shared | Staging root (`auto-import/` requests, `post-validation/` manual review) |
| `/mnt/virtio/music/slskd` | doc2 | slskd download directory |
| `/var/lib/cratedigger` | doc2 | Runtime state (config.ini, lock, denylists) |
| `/var/lib/cratedigger/beets` | doc2 | BEETSDIR — module-rendered beets config.yaml (+ secrets.yaml) |

### Accessing doc2

```bash
ssh doc2 'sudo journalctl -u cratedigger --since "5 min ago"'
ssh doc2 'sudo systemctl start cratedigger --no-block'        # ALWAYS --no-block (oneshot blocks for minutes)
ssh doc2 'sudo cat /var/lib/cratedigger/config.ini'
```

Never background systemctl with `&` inside SSH quotes — SSH waits on all children anyway.

#### Querying the pipeline DB (do this, in this order)

1. **Run the query ON doc2** (`pipeline-cli` is on its PATH). For **write** SQL, `pipeline-cli query` won't work (read-only session) — use `psql "postgresql://cratedigger@10.20.0.11:5432/cratedigger"` on doc2 with `PGPASSWORD` exported.
2. **Pull the live schema first — never guess column names** (query `information_schema.columns`; the schema is deliberately not transcribed here).
3. Then write your query.

Gotchas that cost a lot of time once:
- The pgpass secret is **env-format** (`PGPASSWORD=...`) — extract with `grep '^PGPASSWORD=' | cut -d= -f2`, not `cut -d:`.
- **Pass SQL via stdin heredoc, not argv** — `$$` dollar-quoting expands to the shell PID in argv.

```bash
ssh doc2 'export PGPASSWORD=$(sudo cat /run/secrets/cratedigger-pgpass | grep "^PGPASSWORD=" | cut -d= -f2); pipeline-cli query "$(cat)"' <<'SQL'
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'album_requests' ORDER BY ordinal_position;
SQL
```

### Web dev server

`scripts/web_dev_server.py`: `--data live-db` (real read-only PG + local routes) or `--data prod-api` (local frontend, proxied API). Wrong Matches needs `live-db` on a host that sees the rejected folders (doc1/doc2). Full remote-dev flow in `docs/web-dev-server.md`.

## Repository layout

```
cratedigger.py    — Main loop + thin wrappers; delegates to lib/
album_source.py   — AlbumRecord, DatabaseSource abstraction
web/              — Web UI (server.py, routes/, mb.py, discogs.py, js/)
lib/              — Pipeline modules (quality/ package = pure decisions, split by concern; pipeline_db.py = PG CRUD + advisory locks)
harness/          — beets_harness.py (JSON protocol), import_one.py
migrations/       — Versioned SQL (NNN_name.sql), run by lib/migrator.py
scripts/          — pipeline_cli/ (operator CLI package, split by command family) + dev/ops scripts
tests/            — shared infra in fakes.py + helpers.py
nix/              — package.nix, beets.nix, shell.nix, module.nix, VM check
examples/         — sample consumer + mirror NixOS configs
docs/             — subsystem docs; docs/solutions/ = compounding lessons (grep when debugging)
.claude/rules/    — shared rules (Claude auto-loads; Codex reads as directed below)
```

`lib/config.py`/`lib/context.py` hold the typed `CratediggerConfig`/`CratediggerContext` — never construct a partial config; always `CratediggerConfig.from_ini()`.

## Pipeline flow

```
Web UI / CLI → PostgreSQL (wanted → downloading → imported; wanted ↔ unsearchable)
   Phase 1: poll_active_downloads()   Phase 2: get_wanted() → search + enqueue
   completed download → validate vs exact release ID (dist ≤ 0.15)
   source=request    → stage /Incoming/auto-import  → import_one.py (spectral → convert → quality gate) → /Beets
   source=redownload → stage /Incoming/post-validation (manual review only, never auto-imported)
```

**Don't assume a path under `/Incoming` is a redownload** — request imports can be mid-move or mid-import there too. Schema fields, JSONB audit blobs, and the force-import flow: `docs/pipeline-db-schema.md`.

## CLI ⇄ API surface symmetry

Every operator action lives on **both** `pipeline-cli` and the web API, wrapping the same service-layer method; the two are thin adapters with matched exit-code/status-code mappings. Full pattern table in `.claude/rules/code-quality.md` § "CLI ⇄ API Surface Symmetry" (always loaded).

## Decision architecture

**Quality decisions live in ONE place** — `full_pipeline_decision_from_evidence` in `lib/quality/pipeline.py` (simulator twin `full_pipeline_decision`; the `lib/quality/` package is split by concern per issue #477, `__init__.py` re-exports the full historical surface so `from lib.quality import X` still works everywhere). Preview measures and persists evidence; the importer reads evidence and decides. Never re-create an import decision elsewhere or add a narrower check upstream — full rules in `.claude/rules/code-quality.md` (always loaded). Evidence addressing/propagation policy (content-addressed rows, lossless-source-gated propagation to library rows): `docs/quality-verification.md` § "Evidence addressing, propagation, and ownership".

The importer queue is the beets-mutating ownership boundary: web/CLI/poller enqueue; `cratedigger-importer` drains serially under an advisory singleton lock (startup requeues any `running` job). No new direct beets-mutating entry points outside the importer worker.

Wire-boundary types (harness, JSONB, subprocess stdout) are `msgspec.Struct`, not `@dataclass` — `.claude/rules/code-quality.md` § "Wire-boundary types".

## Deploying changes

Push cratedigger (GitHub) → `nix flake update cratedigger-src` on doc1 → signed commit + push nixosconfig to **Forgejo** (`git.ablz.au` — GitHub nixosconfig is a frozen fallback, never deploy from it) → from doc1 run `fleet-deploy doc2` through the locked-sibling trigger, then poll and verify the exact fleet anchor. `cratedigger.service` has `restartIfChanged = false` (the back-to-back timer picks up new code on the next cycle); web/migrate restart on switch. Before `nix/module.nix` changes, run `nix build .#checks.x86_64-linux.moduleVm`. Full sequence + verification in `.claude/rules/deploy.md`; the `deploy` skill runs it end-to-end.

**PR merges: use GitHub "Create a merge commit"** — never rebase- or squash-merge.

## Database migrations

Schema lives in `migrations/NNN_name.sql`; the migrate oneshot runs them on every switch. `cratedigger-web` and the other long-running workers `requires` the migrate unit and start after it; `cratedigger` and `cratedigger-unfindable` are timer-driven (`restartIfChanged = false`) so they only `wants`+`after` it — a `requires` edge would let the migrate unit's every-deploy restart SIGTERM a mid-flight cycle — and instead gate on schema currency themselves at startup (`lib/migrator.py::assert_schema_current`). Add a numbered SQL file — no manual psql, **never** edit a shipped migration, **never** add DDL inside `PipelineDB` methods. Full workflow in `.claude/rules/deploy.md`.

## Running tests

During implementation, run the smallest relevant test module or JavaScript
test file while converging. After the final tree is reviewed and committed,
run the whole-repository Pyright check and the full suite exactly once before
the first branch push:

```bash
nix-shell --run "python3 -m unittest tests.test_X -v"  # focused iteration
nix-shell --run "pyright --threads 4"                   # final whole repo
nix-shell --run "bash scripts/run_tests.sh"             # final full suite
```

Both final commands must pass on the exact tree that will be pushed. If either
finds a problem, fix it, run focused tests while reconverging, commit and review
the new tree, then restart the final sequence. Do not repeat the final suite for
an unchanged tree after pushing or merging. **ALWAYS `nix-shell --run` for
Python** (`.claude/rules/nix-shell.md`). The suite gates JS syntax + JS tests,
the production typing rules (`pyright -p pyrightconfig.production.json` —
the four mode-independent strict checks over non-test code, #765 phase 2),
Ruff's source-local `F401`/`F811` import check, the aggregate vulture sweep,
then unittest discovery — which includes `tests/test_docs_audit.py`, so the
suite **fails if a new beets plugin, module option, or `pipeline-cli` subcommand
ships undocumented** (or a doc link goes dead); docs are part of "done".
`.claude/rules/code-quality.md` covers the test taxonomy, shared
fakes/builders, the new-work checklist, and the docs-freshness rule.

**Generated (property-based) tests** (`tests/test_*_generated.py`, Hypothesis) run deterministically in the suite; after changing quality policy, run the randomized fuzz burst: `nix-shell --run "bash scripts/fuzz_burst.sh"` (one process per generated module, parallelised to the host's cores — Hypothesis is single-threaded, so never run the burst serially). Failures shrink to minimal worlds — promote them to named `@example` pins or album-test-set scenarios, never JSON artifacts. **New features start by writing their invariants down, and every invariant ships as a PAIR — deterministic pin + generated property — in the same PR, with known-bad self-tests** (`.claude/rules/code-quality.md` § Red/Green TDD). When in doubt that the harness constrains anything, qualify it by fault injection. `docs/generated-testing.md`.

### Skipped tests are an anti-pattern

**A test either runs or it doesn't exist.** No skip decorators, no env-gated tests, no "fixtures must be generated first" — every test runs on every `run_tests.sh` in a fresh dev shell. A skipped test is either irrelevant (delete it) or mis-designed (make it run: Nix-provided binaries, synthetic fixtures in `setUp`, or fakes). `tests/test_skip_audit.py` fails the suite on any skip; there is no allowlist. (History: the suite once said `OK (skipped=56)` for months while 56 tests had never executed once.)

### Hooks

- Pre-commit (`ln -sf ../../scripts/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit`): threaded
  Pyright on staged `.py` and syntax checks on staged JavaScript.
- There is no pre-push hook and CI does not run the suite. The agent owns the
  focused-development/final-validation contract above and pushes only after it
  passes.
- Repository releases are not tagged. The deployed Git commit, signed
  nixosconfig pin, and live verification evidence identify the running state.

## Shared AI surfaces

One authored source exists for each concept; client-specific formats are adapters:

- Instructions: `CLAUDE.md`; `AGENTS.md` is its symlink.
- Skills: `.claude/skills/`; `.agents/skills` is the Codex discovery symlink.
- Shared rules: `.claude/rules/`; Claude auto-loads them and Codex follows the
  loading rule below.
- Specialist agents: `.claude/agents/*.md`; `.codex/agents/*.toml` is generated.
- Project MCP: `.mcp.json`; `.codex/config.toml` is generated.
- Durable learning: `.claude/memory/`, `docs/`, and GitHub issues/PRs.

After editing an agent or `.mcp.json`, run:

```bash
nix-shell --run "python3 tools/generate-ai-adapters.py"
nix-shell --run "python3 tools/generate-ai-adapters.py --check"
```

Never edit generated `.codex/agents/*.toml` or `.codex/config.toml` directly.
Author skills in the common `SKILL.md` format and keep platform-specific tool
names out of workflows where a normal shell/read/edit instruction suffices.

Claude auto-memory and Codex native memory are client-local recall caches, not
project truth. Promote durable discoveries to the shared memory index, docs, or
issue/PR surfaces so either client can recover them. Do not duplicate rationale
across client-local memory stores.

### Shared skills

`deploy` (full deploy sequence) · `debug-download` (live audit trail) · `check`
(pyright + suite) · `beets-docs` (pinned upstream reference) ·
`orchestrate-issue` (isolated multi-PR implementation/review/deploy loop)

### Shared rule loading

Both clients must follow `code-quality.md`, `deploy.md`, `scope.md`, and
`test-fidelity.md` for repository work. Also read the matching path-scoped rule
before touching its surface: `nix-shell.md` (`*.py`, tests, shell), `harness.md`
(`harness/`, `lib/beets.py`, `lib/quality/`), `web.md` (`web/`), and
`pipeline-db.md` (pipeline DB, CLI DB code, migrations). The YAML `paths` lists
inside those files are authoritative.

## Playwright MCP

Browser automation for `music.ablz.au` is authored in the tracked `.mcp.json`;
Codex consumes its generated adapter. Always use HTTPS (HTTP times out).
`docs/playwright-mcp.md`.

## Hunting bugs — generated-first (the house method)

**Bugs are hunted with generated tests, not log-trawling.** Write down the invariant the symptom violates, probe the cheapest suspicious seam with real production functions, then build a generated harness (`tests/test_*_generated.py`) that drives the REAL code path over generated worlds and let Hypothesis find + shrink the reproduction — RED → fix → GREEN in one PR, with the shrunk world pinned forever. Proven on #550: a live bug that static analysis and disk forensics could not reproduce fell to this method in one session. Full workflow: `.claude/rules/code-quality.md` § "Bug Hunting — Generated-First" + `docs/generated-testing.md`.

For quality-decision bugs the simulator is the tool within the method: `pipeline-cli show / quality / debug-download / search-plan show / query` are the diagnostic entry points; add the failing scenario to the album test set and verify against real albums in the live DB. Command reference + triage signals in `docs/debugging-cli.md`.

## Finding dead code

`nix-shell --run "bash scripts/find_dead_code.sh"` (source-local Ruff `F401`/`F811`, then aggregate vulture vs `tools/vulture/whitelist.py`). After deleting, regenerate the vulture whitelist and watch for **cascading orphans** (deleting one helper exposes its callees). Full workflow: `docs/dead-code.md`.

## Critical rules

1. **NEVER `beet remove -d`** — deletes files permanently (exceptions: ban-source and Replace, both explicit operator actions via `lib/release_cleanup.py::remove_and_reset_release`).
2. **NEVER import without inspecting the match** — always through the harness.
3. **NEVER match by `candidate_index`** — always by MB release ID.
4. **NEVER match by release group** — release groups conflate pressings.
5. **Auto-import only for `source='request'`** — redownloads always stage for manual review.
6. **All code deploys via Nix** — no manual `cp` to virtiofs.
7. **PostgreSQL uses `autocommit=True`** — prevents idle-in-transaction deadlocks; migrations use separate short-lived connections with `lock_timeout`.

## Resolved — canonical RCs (don't re-investigate)

Settled; read the solution doc instead of reopening.

- **Palo Santo data loss** (2026-04-20) — misplaced `duplicate_keys` (top-level, silently ignored) let a cross-MBID sibling be wiped. NOT a beets bug. `docs/solutions/runtime-errors/palo-santo-duplicate-keys-data-loss.md`.
- **Lucksmiths MBID drift** (2026-04-14) — deliberate out-of-band retag; NOT a bug. `docs/solutions/runtime-errors/lucksmiths-mbid-drift-out-of-band-harness.md`.
- **asciify_paths Plex mass-split** (2026-05-18) — path-affecting beets change + `beet move` split 1,178 Plex albums; fix is the Plex merge API. **Footgun: any beets change that mutates rendered paths + `beet move` re-triggers this.** `docs/solutions/runtime-errors/plex-asciify-paths-album-split.md`.

## Secrets

- slskd API key + notifier creds: sops-managed `*File` paths (issue #117 pattern), materialized by the wrapper's secrets-split oneshot. See `docs/nixos-module.md`.
- Discogs token: `/var/lib/cratedigger/secrets/discogs-token` on doc2 (`root:cratedigger-ops 0440` — group-readable so the non-root cratedigger service can read it, via a durable one-time `chown` since tmpfiles can't manage it across the state-dir's non-root ownership transition), rendered into the beets `secrets.yaml` by the module's preStart.
